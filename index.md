# To Use
Step 1. Add JitPack repository
Add the JitPack repository to the project's build.gradle
<pre><code>allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
</code></pre>

Step 2. Add dependencies
Add dependencies to the modules that need to be used (see KYCCamera for the latest version )
```java
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.Gauravhulmukh:KYCCamera:v1.1'
	}
```
Or refer to the local lib
```
compile project(':KYCCamera')
```
